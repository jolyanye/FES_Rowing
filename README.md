# Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Rowing Coaching Application

## Overview

This project is a **Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) coaching application** designed for **spinal cord injury (SCI) patients** to aid them in rowing exercises using an FES-rowing ergometer. The app helps users by automatically switching electrical stimulation between **hamstring** and **quadriceps** muscle groups, improving their ability to engage in physical activity and rehabilitation exercises. May 2024 - August 2024 for University Health Network (UHN) and Motion & Adaptation Science Laboratory (MASL).

## Features

- **Timed Muscle Stimulation**: Automatically controls the switching of FES between muscle groups (hamstrings and quadriceps) based on a set schedule.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use, providing clear indicators of stimulation timing and muscle activity.
- **Real-Time Data Acquisition**: Integrated with **NI Data Acquisition Interface** for real-time data monitoring.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allows customization of stimulation intervals to suit the userâ€™s rehabilitation plan.
- **Testing Compatibility**: Successfully tested with an FES-rowing ergometer, demonstrating clinical feasibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Interface**: NI Data Acquisition (NI DAQ)
- **Development Tools**: Integrated with FES-rowing ergometer for real-time testing
- **User Interface**: Developed using Python libraries for easy interaction and control
